# Cloud Providers - `AWS`

## 1. Compute & Containers

- `EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)` - Fundamental for understanding AWS virtual infrastructure
- `ECS/EKS` - Container orchestration (Docker and Kubernetes), `Fargate`
- `Lambda` - Serverless computing for automation and event-driven architecture
- **`Batch`** - Batch computing jobs

## 2. Infrastructure as Code

- `CloudFormation/Terraform` - AWS-native IaC solution
- `Systems Manager` - Configuration management and automation

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline: (`Jenkins`)

- `CodeCommit` - Source control repository
- `CodeBuild` - Continuous integration service
- `CodeDeploy` - Automated deployment service
- `CodePipeline` - Pipeline orchestration

## 4. Networking

- `VPC` - Virtual network design and security
- `Route 53` - DNS management
- `Elastic Load Balancing` - Load balancing for applications

## 5. Storage

- `S3` - Object storage (crucial for artifacts, backups, static content)
- `EBS` - Block storage management
- `S3 Glacier` - Low-cost archive storage

## 6. Security

- `IAM` - Identity and access management (roles, policies, permissions)
- `Secrets Manager` - Secure storage of credentials and API keys
- `Security Groups & NACLs` - Network security

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

- `CloudWatch` - Monitoring, logging, and alarming
- `X-Ray` - Application tracing and performance analysis
- `CloudTrail` - API activity tracking for security and compliance

## 8. Database Management

- `RDS` - Managed relational database service
- `DynamoDB` - NoSQL database management
- `DocumentDB` - MongoDB-compatible database
- `MemoryDB` - Redis-compatible in-memory database
-
- `Neptune` - Graph database
- `ElastiCache` - In-memory caching
- `Keyspaces` - Cassandra-compatible database

## 9. Advanced Services

- `Cloud Development Kit (CDK)` - Infrastructure as actual code
- `Service Catalog` - Standardized service provisioning
- `Organizations & Control Tower` - Multi-account management
- `Elastic Beanstalk` - PaaS for application deployment
